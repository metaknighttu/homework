This program uses namespaces for each of the products the
store carries. The program starts by creating pointers to NULL
to track the store's stock, then initializes them with new arrays.
Their values are set from their respective namespaces, then the
cart's pointer is created and set to a new array that tracks
how many of each item is being purchased. The program then asks
the user how many of each product they are purchasing, calculates
the cost of the purchase, and afterwards reprints the updated stock.
