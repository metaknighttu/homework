This program will execute in 3 parts. Part 1 will initiate
a Square object and a Triangle object, both of which are derived
from an abstract Shape object. The program will then test thier
member functions for calcualting perimeter and area and then print
them. Part 2 will test the command line parameters included in the
main function. Part 3 will test the square's associated
friend functions and overloaded operators.
