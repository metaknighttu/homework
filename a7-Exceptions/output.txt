This program will test assert macros and Exception handling.
The first execution will fail to meet the assert macro's parameters
And terminate. The second will get past the assert, and show the
throws done by the square class objects and the catches that get them
by printing the values that triggered them. The throws will also set
the variables to an accepted value.
Program Start!
